 To get started:
<br />
You can run the program anyway you want but I recommend using Node.js and the express framework to run locally.
<br />
Step 1: go to root folder and type into the command/terminal npm init -y (initialize node)
<br />
Step 2: npm install express --save (to install the package dependecy for express)
<br />
Step 3: use hte server.js file and change port if you want 
<br />
Step 4: type into terminal node server.js to run the program and by default you can find the server starting on: http://localhost:3000
<br />
