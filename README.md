 To get started:
<br />
You can run the program anyway you want but I recommend using Node.js and the express framework to run locally.
<br />
Step 1: go to root folder and type into the command/terminal npm init -y (initialize node)
<br />
Step 2: npm install express --save (to install the package dependecy for express)
<br />
Step 3: use hte server.js file and change port if you want 
<br />
Step 4: type into terminal node server.js to run the program and by default you can find the server starting on: http://localhost:3000
<br />
<br />
After you have downloaded the files, if the program doesn't work, you may have to change the API key. 
<br />
On line 3 of the script.js file, head over to huggingface.co and create an account. For this app, we will leverage the AI Models that huggingface offers, more specifically the prompthero/openjourney model . After, head into your profile and copy and paste your profile token into
the apiKey.
<br />
Afterwords, everyhing should work perfectly!
